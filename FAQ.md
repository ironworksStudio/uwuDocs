Daily reminder: Sit up, stretch for a second. Are you hydrated? :) Be kind to yourself.

#marketboard
Marketboard tip! You should read the full description of items when you hover over them in the Market board. If you see something like "Vendor shop price" it means it's sold by an npc and is likely cheaper. People tend to buy from NPCs and sell stuff on the marketboard at a higher price as the "lazy tax". If it says (restricted) it's likely a quest NPC/beast tribe npc you gotta unlock. Also: HQ items have better stats than normal quality!

### FC messages

#pervyjokes #NSFW 
note to our new members: We are totes ok with pervy jokes, double entendres and what not :) There's a line though, and we dont allow crude gross shit, erp in the fc chat, etc. And if someone asks you to stop or not include them, pls stop
#rolesExplanation

#extrials #extreme 
You should never queue for synced extreme trials (aka. "ex trials") through duty finder. They require a level of experience that's not expected of the normal player and will be awful. If you want to run any lv 50 ex trials, you can reliably solo them as a lv 80 (or ask someone in here to help). Lv 60 trials require maybe 2-3 people, lv 70/80 require a full party and require tons of practice and watching videos. 

You'll only ever queue with two types of people: mentors angry that they got stuck in an EX synced trial, and sprouts who didn't know of the pain to come and may not know mechanics or how to even play their classes.

#welcometoFC
If you need anything, please let me know! We have a discord with tons of resources (discord.onee-chan.info), an FC house you can come and visit/hang out at with a convenient marketboard/retainer bell, we also have a ton of dyes/glamour prisms/etc u can grab in the first two fc chest slots. 

#silentfc
Hey guys~ I'll be posting this over and over again for like the next forever so pls don't mind the spam uwu We have tons of silent peeps in the FC and I wanna make sure you all know that if you need someone to run content with, have any questions, or want to chat - there's likely someone always available~

#referral
You can generate a referral code and refer a friend. You can do this after they buy the game but BEFORE they subscribe. VERY IMPORTANT that they dont subscribe until they redeem your referral code. Once they redeem it, you both get chocobo feathers (gold and silver, used for different things), and there's feather exclusive mounts/other stuff that helps ppl get started/helps you get neat shit. https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/friend_recruit/


#idyllshire #wondroustails
To our newer players, any time you enter a dungeon for the first time and want some help or people to play with just let us know!! When players hit Idyllshire in Heavensward, you're able to grab a "Wondrous tails" book. Basically you gotta collect stamps in order to get cool weekly rewards. If you ever are about to run a new piece of content, just give us a shout here on FC chat. If people with books run content with players who haven't completed it before, we get points for the books.

The best part about wondrous tails is that even if you get no lines you still get 50% of a level worth of EXP from it. It's always worth getting it every week on Tuesdays. You technically have 2 weeks to complete each book, but you can get one new book a week so it's recommended you do them weekly.

#discord 
Discord link can be found under the "Company board" by navigating to the Free Company menu ( ; on PC), then going to "Topics" on the left :) Also you can navigate to discord.onee-chan.info on your browser and get the invite that way!

#mb 
For weapons: Select ur main class, go to lv 80, then right click the ones w the blue background > try on then unsheathe them in the preview and you'll see their shiny effects

For glams: Select lv1, All classes, then on the top right sort by demand and u can see whats typically more expensive/sought after

#teleport #fchouse
You can use your teleport menu to teleport to the FC house! Go to the teleport icon and at the top you'll see 'Residential Areas'.  Click on "The Goblet - Estate Hall (Free Company)" and you'll find us :) Tons of us hang out here, and we have a really convenient market board and retainer bell. We also own a few houses around the FC house, if you wanna hang out there as well ^.^ 

### Hunts 

So there's S ranks and A ranks in every expansion, and typically the older expansions get allied seals, stormblood gives centurio seals i think? And shadowbringers gives nuts. These are used to trade for different items like dyable class armors, minions, mounts... and the nuts are used to enhance end game gear as we

#Ranks
What are ranks:
To those of us who are newer to the game or maybe not familiar with this, There are different "ranks" of monsters. You can tell these guys apart cus they're usually that one lv 50 mob in that low level map, and they have a special icon next to their name. B ranks spawn every 15 minutes, A ranks spawn every 6 hours and S ranks are super rare and require a trigger to spawn them every few days.

A hunt train is a piece of content where players get together to kil lall teh A ranks in a particular expansion so everyone ges credit

#SRankSpawn
It'll spawn when you see a grey message in your chat box, something like "You sense the presence of a powerful mark", but please do not attack it!! I will call a "pull time" - that way plenty of people can all come together and get points for the skill :)

#trainEnmity
To my sprouts: Typically you see tons of healers/tanks b/c the more u heal and the more enmity u generate the more credit we get towards the kill, which helps us max out the rewards we get from each kill

### Combat

#GCDs #oGCDs
The game's skills are divided in to two categories: Global Cool Downs (GCDs) and Off Global Cooldown (OGCDs) skills. GCDs happen every 2.5 seconds and OGCDs can be cast any time around that. The best way to improve your performance in game is to "ABC" - Always Be Casting. That means NEVER miss a GCD "window" (aka. you should always click a GCD when its up, every 2.5 secs), and "Weave" in your OGCDs inbetween. This maximizes DPS and helps you get better at your class :) 

#LB 
typically it's reserved for DPS (In this order: melee, ranged magic, ranged physical) to use to finish off the boss, and there's 3 different levels of it. If you hover over the icon it explains to you what each level does. Very rarely is it ever used by tanks, and in late game content/raids where u can get lb3 it's often reserved for healers to insta-rezz everyone in an "oh shit" moment

### Gearing up
#endgamegear https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WUSU8iCfL4GHpHX89okK-NiFNOSHSJ6W8VOsFEZmT4k/edit#heading=h.mha1qn6yt717
The current end game gear consists of ilvl 530 gear. The Edenmorn pieces can only be obtained through savage raiding (hardest raiding tier right now for 8-man raids), or you can get the Augmented Cryptlurker gear. The Augmented Cryptlurker requires you to buy Cryptlurker gear with Tomes of Revelation and then augment them using specific items. Left side quipment requires Crypt Twine, right side requires Crypt Dusting.

Something important to note is that the "current tier" of end game raids will most likely have weekly loot restrictions. You can identify them by going to the "Information" part of the Duty Finder after selecting the raid you want to look at and see if it says "Awards Obtainable: Weekly". This means that no matter how many times you run that, you will only ever get rewards ONCE. In the Alliance raids, you will get a coin the first time you run it and you can only obtain ONE equipment drop. 

Good news is that you can pick what equipment item to roll for from the alliance raids. So if you run the first raid of the week, and you dont get an item drop you want/you dont win a roll, you will see under your duty finder "2/3 rewards obtained" at the bottom of the info page. You can run as many times as you need to in order to get the equipment you want, but you will only ever get ONE reward of each category it's giving. You can roll for the minions/scrolls/hairstyles as much as you want.

As far as the eden raids are concerned, you will only get rewards the FIRST TIME you run them each week.  Per week, you get one book from each raid (can be traded for gear). If all players have NOT cleared that week, two chests appear. 1-5 NOT cleared, 1 chest. If you queue in to a later raid in the series without completing/getting rewards for one before that then you ARE FORFEITING YOUR WEEKLY REWARDS regardless if you clear or not. (Aka. DO NOT Queue in to E10S before you get rewards for E9S)

You get Crypt Twine and Dusting from Sack of Nuts exchange, by trading in a specific weekly book you get from the savage raids, or from turning in one of each of the coins you get from the 3 alliance raids in Shadowbringers. 

#weeklyrewards 

 1st you'll craft your exarchic gear, 2nd you will upgrade exarchic gear to "augmented exarchic" using allagan tomestones of allegory in Eulmore. Since Allagan tomestones of Revelation have a weekly cap of 450, you'll then spend a few weeks getting them and getting any Cryptlurker gear that your BIS guide says to get from the balance... At this point you are more than ready to attempt savage raid content which will help you get the real "end game" edenmorn pieces.
 
 #poetics 
 if you ever are in doubt, here's the "typical" order to follow: 1. Gear up your classes, having one set of each "Archetype" of gear tends to be enough... like all healers share the "healing" sets, etc. 2. Buy stuff for any future relics you wanna get (special "end of expansion" weapons. Older ones are just for glams, but the current ones in SHB at the very end are good for stats), 
 
 3. Once you've bought everything youve ever wanted w/poetics u can buy unidentifiable ore and trade it for grade 3 thanalan topsoil in idyllshire (bertana) and make nice gil. Your #1 goal is to never cap on poetics, or to not stay capped cus that's just a waste

#saveHUD
There's two ways to copy your hud layout: 1. Go to the FFXIV folder, copy your character data folder & paste it on your new computer. 2. Before logging in, click on the gear next to the character and you can upload your current config to the server... then download it where you want. VERY IMPORTANT: Make sure to do it FIRST on the computer with the settings you wanna back up (for both steps).

#relicweapons
Every expansion pack has something called a "Relic weapon". While the expansion is "current content", they will typically be end game weapons with the best stats. They are super grindy to get, have several "steps" towards completion, and you should definitely look up a guide to do them. A Realm Reborn = Zodiac weapons, Heavensward = Anima weapons, Stormblood = Eureka, Shadowbringers = Rebellion/Save the Queen. 

#navigatingtorune
from our FC, go to the athernet shard and teleport to "Goblet north",Then you will act like ur walking out of the goblet, by going to ur left, and walking past the blue bar, this will bring up the wards menu and u can click on ward 9 then teleport there and then u can go to the aetheryte and teleport to... goblet east

#castrum #prae
Castrum Meridianum and Praetorium are notoriously long. They have unskippable cutscenes, players rush through them b/c they're a part of a daily roulette, and an awful experience for sprouts. Take your time, have fun and grab snacks :) Don't worry about dying, fighting or anything, the whole thing is a meme... you may end up dying at a few spots cus no one actually attacks mobs, they just run :P 

#raids 
Every expansion has 12x 8-person "Normal" raids (ARR has 13), 3x 24-person "Alliance" raids, and several 8-person "Trials" (aka where you fight one big boss). Most of these things are unlocked as part of the story, or as part of side quests (blue quests with +s on them). There's roulettes tied to these different categories. Also, raids can be Normal, Savage or Unreal, trials can be Normal, Extreme, or Ultimate.

#crystaltower
Crystal tower is an example of an Alliance Raid. It's required before you can do 5.0, and generally you should do all your post-patch side quests to unlock these things as they unlock daily roulettes, but take your time :)

#GCSeals
GC Seal priority: 1. VENTURES - You can buy retainer ventures here to use with your retainers. They bring you back TONS of goodies and you can make BANK. 2. Promotions - these cost seals, promote yourself as much as you can. This expands your seal carrying capacity and has tons of other perks as well! 3. Bardings/Minions/Etc - There's collectables in here you can get w/seals! 4. Gil making items - There's items that sell on the market board for ok amounts of money. Typically prisms, or coke.

#chocobofeathers 
BTW guys reminder: If you know anyone who has bought the game but has NOT signed up for the subscription, you can generate a referral code and you can earn your chocobo feathers :D And they also get goodies! 

So every FC can have two active "actions" (You can go to the FC menu then go to the actions tab and you'll see the ones we have active). You can purchase lv 1 and lv2 actions from the grand company if you are high enough rank in an FC and you can activate them if u have the right rank. Each lasts 24 hours. In order to get lv 3 buffs, you have to craft them at the fc shop and then charge them for 3 days in the aetherial wheel stand. You can only charge 1 buff at a time. 

#squadron #recruits
Go to your challenge log > there's differen't categories. Any time you complete one of those challenges you have a chance to trigger a recruit to show up at your barracks once per week. (This is on the weekly reset every tueday morning at 4am). Each category can recruit different recruits, there's 5 of each gender for a total of 10 per race.  You can only trigger one recruit per category per week.

Squadron recruits are recruited by completing tasks in your challenge logs. There are a total of 10 recruits of each race, and 5 of each gender per race. They all have different "reasons" for joining you, which are the same categories as you have in your challenge log. Each time you complete one challenge log item you have a CHANCE of getting a recruit. You can only get ONE recruit per category per week (resets every tuesday w every other timer). U can buy manuals from ur GC to increase chance.

#static 
Chase if you visit the discord we have a group-organization channel that you can either create statics in, recruit members for content you wanna run, or see what people are up to. We do have some days here and tehre on the FC calendar that we run event nights like maps, mount farming, etc, and we also have statics organized thru our discord, but you should check the channel for more info :D

#static
 Statics is a term used to describe a group of people who run content together. Typically it is in an organized fashion with specific dates/times/nights of the week that you meet and get together for a common goal (typically progressing through difficult content, learning fights, etc.)
 
 #chatlog 
 In order to edit your chat settings, you click on the settings gear below the chat box. Go down to log filters on the first tab and you can change these to your liking. You can rename the last two tabs by right clicking on them under the chat window, but not the first two. If you want to change the 3rd tab to just FC, you would click on the tab name under the log filters menu, click on the "Uncheck all" button, then go to chat tab and select free company and then hit apply.
 
 You can also click + drag the chat names around to make multiple windows :) My setup is: General (Everything minus a few CWLS/LS and NN), Battle (Only my CWLS/LS and NN), Hunts (Only my Hunting LS/CWLS), System (in a different window, but default filter settings)

 #FCChatRules 
 
 #FCChatRules #NSFW
We have some somewhat nebulous rules, but here's the basics of what i expect in FC chat: 1. We assume everyone is at least 18. If you are below 17, do NOT state your age. I haven't kicked anyone on age, but this is NOT a family friendly place, and i dont really wanna change that. 2. RESPECT EACH OTHER. No matter what. 3. No graphic detailing of sexual acts/other shit to anyone, especially if they are not consenting. 4. We can totally be pervy, and suggesting and playful, but if you ever wanna stop, you can say stop and the other people must respect it or else.
 
 
#companion #chocobo 
Your Chocobo Companion is basically your buddy. He can fight with you, he can store items for you (ctrl + shift + i to access the chocobo saddle bag), and he follows you if you use a Gysahl Green item. He can only show up in non-town areas/maps (aka. where mobs spawn) and he can level up with you. You should put points in to maxing out healer stance first, then go from there wherever you want. You can ALSO ride him as a mount, by choosing "Company chocobo". You can also change his color/outfit!

 Level him up, put all points in to healing, and he can help you with any overworld stuff like fates and quest mobs. His DPS isn't great, he can't tank for you, but he can sure as shit heal you! 1 gysahl green = 30 minutes of IRL time he'll be summoned, and you can summon him anywhere you can fight overworld mobs. You also cannot summon him if you stabled him at any stables at your house/the fc house. You need to stable him to change his color. riding your summoned choco using the company choco command also halts the timer for companion, good way to save on greens
 
 #squadron 
 
 #unsync
 You can unsync content by clicking on the duty finder's gear in the top left corner. You can then select "Undersized party" and that will let us complete content as our max level and will not sync down our levels to meet the duty's level.
 
 #retainerclass 
 Retainers can be either combat classes or gatherers. It doesn't matter what combat class you pick, cus they all get the same "ventures" to go on, but each gatherer can only gather items you've already gathered. They level according to how many ventures u send them on, but they will only level as high as your own class is. So make sure to pick a high level class or one you know you're gonna max soon. You give them "jobs" to do by using ventures purchased most efficiently with grand company seals
 
 #leveling #howtolevel
 Check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkj8YvVE3l8 for a decent leveling guide. TL;DR: MSQ is always best for leveling, but you'll out level it so we suggest you grab a second class to level in tandem. Every level: All Daily roulettes except guildhests. LV 1-20: Hunt log, Lv 21-60: Squadron missions (In your grand company) or PoTD, 61-70: HoH, 71-80: Bozja or Pixie beast tribe. Every week, Wondrous Tails gets you half a level of exp. Best way to complete lv 79.
 
 #materia
 Right off the bat, I always advice to not worry about materia until level 80. The stats provided at lower levels are not worth the cost/time consumption of using materia on gear you're gonna be switching in and out of rapidly.
 
 Another tip: As you level/die/wear your armor it will both gain "spiritbond" and it will deteriorate. It's good to keep an eye out on your equipment's condition and spirit bond to make sure that you either repair the equipment at a vendor or extract the materia generated bby the spirit bond when it's at 100%. If your gear condition is 0% you will not gain any stats/ilevel from it, and it's like youre not wearing anything. EXTRACTING materia from an equipment item generates a brand new materia. RETRIEVING materia is removing materia that's already on your gear, so be careful which one you select.
 
 #flying #ridingmap #speed
 As players progress, the speed of mounts on the ground will increase in two stages. The first is via quest lines, whereas the second is via purchasable enhancements. All mounts have the same base movement speed increase. While flying, mounts have 200% speed of a regular running mount.

 2nd star: ARR: Buy riding map from Grand Company Hunt Billmaster in your GC. HW: Buy Riding map from Ardolain in ishgard. SB: Buy riding map for centurio seals in Kugane/Rhalgr's Reach. ShB the star is obtained by purchasing it from each map's bicolor gemstones vendor.
 
 #AetherCurrents
 
 Unlock flying in ARR by finishing the 2.0 MSQ. HW currents are unlocked after completing MSQ "Divine Intervention". HW/SB Have 15 currents per map. ShB has 10 currents per map with 5 tied to the MSQ. www.heavenswhere.com is a great site if you need help finding them.
